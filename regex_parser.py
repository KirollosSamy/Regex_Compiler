            algorithm for converting NFA to DFA (powerset construction):

                1. create a new start state and add it to the DFA states
                    a. each state is a set of NFA states
                    b. the start state is the epsilon closure of the start state of the NFA

                2. add the epsilon closure of the new start state to the DFA states
                    a. begin with epsilon closure of the start state of the NFA

                3. while there is an unmarked state in the DFA states:
                    a. mark the state as visited.

                    b. for each possible action in the alphabet:
                        i. find the epsilon closure of the union of the next states of the current state
                           in the NFA for the action
                        ii. if the closure is not in the DFA states, add it
                        iii. add a transition from the current state to the closure
                    
                    c. repeat step 3 until all states are marked

                4. the acceptance states of the DFA are the states that contain an acceptance state of the NFA
                    a. if a state contains an acceptance state of the NFA, it is an acceptance state of the DFA

                5. return the DFA
